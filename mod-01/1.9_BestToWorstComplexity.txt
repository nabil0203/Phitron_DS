which one is best??
=>
Easy way to get this, is to assume any value for 'N'
Then compare.
The smaller one is the best!!!!


if N = 1000


Constant        : O(1)          -> 1
Linear          : O(N)          -> 1000
Logarithmic     : O(logN)       -> 10
Square Root     : O(sqrtN)      -> 32
Quadratic       : O(N^2)        -> 1000000
Linearithmic    : O(NlogN)      -> 1000
